    "paragraph1": "Three Degrees East was born from a shared desire to reconnect — with self, with nature, and with India's deep-rooted traditions. We create soulful journeys that honour the sacred and celebrate the simple.",
    "paragraph2": "Led by women and guided by purpose, our retreats offer more than escape — they invite transformation. With every step, chant, or meal, we hold space for reflection, healing, and the joy of rediscovery."

    "title": "TRAVEL",
    "paragraph1": "India isn't just a destination — it's a deep exhale for your soul. Beyond the postcard-perfect Taj Mahal and colourful clichés, this is where ancient wisdom meets modern awakening. From Himalayan sunrises that still the mind to temple bells that stir the heart, every corner invites you to slow down, breathe deeper, and reconnect.",
    "paragraph2": "Here, wellness isn't a trend — it's a way of life passed down through centuries of yoga, Ayurveda, and spiritual practice. Come for the culture, stay for the transformation. India doesn't just change your view — it changes you."
